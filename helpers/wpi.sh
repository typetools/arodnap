# Where is WPI's output placed by the Checker Framework? This is some
# directory ending in build/whole-program-inference. For most projects,
# this directory is just ./build/whole-program-inference .
# The example in this script is the output directory when running via the gradle plugin.
# (The CF automatically puts all WPI outputs in ./build/whole-program-inference,
# where . is the directory from which the javac command was invoked (ie, javac's
# working directory). In many build systems (e.g., Maven), that directory would be the project.
# But, some build systems, such as Gradle, cache build outputs in a central location
# per-machine, and as part of that it runs its builds from that central location.)
# The directory to use here might vary between build systems, between machines
# (e.g., depending on your local Gradle settings), and even between projects using the
# same build system (e.g., because of a project's settings.gradle file).

# Program needs to compiled before running script so WPI creates this directory.
