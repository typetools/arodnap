# FieldCanBeFinalWithTryCatch (Error Prone Plugin)

This is a custom Error Prone plugin that extends the standard `FieldCanBeFinal` check by adding support for analyzing fields even when assignments occur inside `try-catch` blocks.

The plugin identifies fields that can be safely marked as `final`, even when their assignments are placed inside complex control-flow structures, and generates automatic fix suggestions to apply the `final` modifier or transform the code accordingly.

This plugin integrates smoothly with Error Proneâ€™s patching system and can be used to automatically apply suggested fixes. For details on how to invoke Error Prone plugins and use patching mode, refer to the official documentation:
