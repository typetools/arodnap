# AutoClose Injector

This project provides a set of tools to automatically inject `AutoCloseable` interface implementation and a `close` method into Java classes that handle resources like streams but do not properly close them. It utilizes the JavaParser library to parse and modify Java source files based on warnings generated by the Checker Framework.

## Features

- **AutoCloseable Implementation**: Automatically implements the `AutoCloseable` interface for Java classes that manage resources.
- **Close Method Injection**: Adds a `close` method to classes to properly close resources, such as streams, when they are no longer needed.
- **Patch Generation**: Generates patch files to apply the modifications to the original Java source files.
- **Warning Parsing**: Parses warning messages from the Checker Framework to identify classes and fields that need modification.
- **Test Suite**: Includes unit tests to verify the correct behavior of the code injection and patch generation processes.

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven

## Installation

1. Build the project using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

## Usage
### MainApplication
The `MainApplication` reads warning messages from the Checker Framework and injects the AutoCloseable interface and close method into the identified classes.

To run the `MainApplication`, use:
```bash
java -jar target/AutoCloseInjector-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <warning-file-path> <project-directory>
```

- `<warning-file-path>`: Path to the warning file generated by the Checker Framework.
- `<project-directory>`: Path to the project directory containing the Java source files.
