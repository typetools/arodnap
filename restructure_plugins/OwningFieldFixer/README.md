# OwningFieldFixer

This tool automates detection and repair of owning field reassignment issues in Java projects.  

It parses log files generated by the Checker Framework Resource Leak Checker (RLC), identifies non-final owning fields that may be reassigned, and attempts to modify those fields by adding `private` and/or `final` modifiers. Each change is verified by recompiling the project, and only successful patches are kept.


### Usage

```bash
java -jar OwningFieldFixer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --log inf-log.txt --project-root /path/to/project
```
